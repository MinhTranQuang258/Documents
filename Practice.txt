1. Given an array of integers, count number of occurrence of number 9 in that array.
2. Count the number of "xx" in the given string. We'll say that overlapping is allowed, so "xxx" contains 2 "xx"
3. Remove all the sequence "yak" in a given string. The "yak" strings will not overlap.
4. The number 6 is a truly great number. Given two int values, a and b, return true if either one is 6. Or if their sum or difference is 6.
5. Given two arrays of integer sorted in increasing order, A and B, return true if all of the numbers in A appear in B.
6. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
